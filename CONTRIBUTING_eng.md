# Introduction

Thanks for contributing to Fruits API. Before you begin, please note the following:

## Issues

1. If there is already an issue that you would like to claim, please comment on it so that it can be assigned to you.
2. Or, if you find a problem that does not have an issue, please create one so that it can be reviewed, and thus accept your pull request (PR)

## Get the Local Project

To get the project on your local computer, follow the instructions in [README.md](readme_eng.md)

## Make Changes

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/es/enterprise-server@3.1/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to create a copy in your GitHub account.
2. Create a new working branch so you can make changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge your request.

- `git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME`
  - create and switch to that new branch for work
  - if you want to check that you're no longer in `main` or `master` just use `git branch` to check which branch you're in
- Make any changes that solve the issue you were assigned to, or discovered

3. When you think you've solved the issue, commit the changes and upload (push) them to GitHub

- `git add .` add all the files you changed
- `git commit -m 'message about the changes you made'` commit the changes to the repository
- `git push origin NEW_BRANCH_NAME` to push the commits to GitHub
## Pull Request (PR)

When you have pushed the change commit, create a Pull Request (PR), include:

- [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/es/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- A description of what the request adds to the repository.
- We may require changes before merging your request
